# Your challenges...

1: [Diagnostic] Work out under what circumstances this goes wrong

2: [Bug fixing] Fix at least one of the things you found in the above

3: [Simple extra functionality] Show the product of the three numbers as well as the sum

4: [More complex functionality] Show the biggest of the three numbers

5: [Refactorisation within PHP] Move the calculations into a class

6: [Wider Refactorisation] Dynamically add additional inputs (starting with just one). The calculations should still be done server-side.


DON'T PANIC: No-one has ever completed all of these in the interview :-)
